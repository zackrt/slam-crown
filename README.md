Slam Crown is a concussion and mild traumatic brain injury reporting web app.

This repo is the front end client side version of the app.

Slam Crown allows users to create an account and login to their unique user page. On the User page they can report their daily concussion sypmtoms, type in additional sypmtoms, rate their pain level (1-5) and track their report history. 


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
